/* 
So pattern is basically a reusable solution that can be applied to occurring problems in software design.

You can also think of them as programming templates and a way to to create a specific way for writing

Some patterns like the factory and prototype patterns are used for object creation.

The module pattern and all of its variations are used for overall structure.
and these can apply to whole applications or to just little blocks of code.

We've already used some of the patterns and parts of patterns such as the constructor.

It allows us to break our code up into modules or we can have private private functions and variables
and public private functions and variables singleton which is kind of a variation of the module pattern
where we can only create one instance of an object.

The factory pattern which is used to create many many objects in the Observer pattern which allows us
to basically subscribe and unsubscribe to events.
